## My process
This was easy to make! I'm still practicing media queries so it's always challenging for me to create the perfect outcome to the original design.

The platform and the comments of the community are very helpful for me to keep learning and fix some things that could be done better to make the site way more responsive!

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### Useful resources

- [<picture> Element](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/picture) - Someone shared this resource in one of my latest solutions and found it really helpful when switching images depending of the window size, instead of manually switching them through media queries.
- [Use the <img> tag as a background image](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/31267425/use-the-html-img-tag-as-a-background-image-instead-of-the-css-background-image/74097622#74097622) - In regard of the first resource, this one helped me to set the background images in a easy way.
